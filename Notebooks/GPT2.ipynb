            " Samson was not the way to bring in the money, so instead, his young daughter, Helen, takes the opportunity to be a prostitute to a young, attractive young man named Gansler (Fowler), who agrees to marry her. When Helen discovers a hidden bank account where his daughter has fallen in love with him, the two travel to a remote part of Texas and begin a romance that will eventually lead to Gansler's wedding. While Gansler is traveling in the country, Helen encounters a posse from the local Mexican band of outlaws who have taken aim at him. As the money is lost in the storm, Helen kills the bandits. During the storm, one of the bandits comes up with a clever way of tricking the outlaws into believing Lacey is his real son. The Band of the Dead comes in to rescue Helen, but by the time the men realize that Lacey has abandoned them, they have grown to mistrust Lacey personally. In a dramatic twist, the band members also return the money from the bank they stole.\n",

He works as a miner and travels as a train car driver, working for his brother, Tom (William Nance), the railroad boss. While driving in a town to Fort Mason, Tom hires the driver Tom has been working for years to replace him: Pete (Bob Dylan), a rustler. Tom's friend, Jack (Charles Bronson), is a rancher who also works for the boss.\n",
            "At a saloon, Pete gets to know a drunk woman called Little Bear (Barbara Comstock). She is now Tom's girlfriend and his niece's sweetheart. At the dance hall, Pete discovers a corpse of Tom's young daughter, Helen. On a card table he discovers a note Tom left her. A note Tom has hidden from Helen about his past life. The note contains a line from a song he has always known, which he has only heard and read aloud to other men from his tribe.\n",
            "As the Indians near the river near Sam Houston's hometown, Pete helps to clear up a few of the dead Indians, who had led him away from the river and his tribe. Soon after, they encounter a violent Native American attack. Tom finds the tribe on the bank of the stream opposite the saloon. They are attacked by the same kind of Indian attacks Tom had previously noticed.\n",
            "Meanwhile, the Indians attack Sam. Pete, his sister-in-law Little Bear, and an Indian girl are captured, and all the remaining Indian warriors are killed. When Tom goes to defend the girl, Pete is shot in the back. After the attack, Tom is saved after Tom's father, a famous Apache priest, and the other survivors escape. When Tom returns to save his sister, the priest and the girl escape with his son and they have a child with little Clara (Julie Wray), who wants to travel with him on her way to a remote mountain town, called El Dorado.\n",

Martha has no children; Martha's father is an important member of the plantation's society; their land is divided among white settlers, and it falls under the control of the white proprietors.\n",

            "Following their showdown, the three men go to the Olinger ranch, where Gannon, who is in love with Fitch, tries to blackmail the other two. When Fitch tries to flee, they both ambush him. The ranch hand is killed before Gannon can kill Fitch. The final showdown is nearly as bloody as the robbery, but Fitch is able to prevail. When the gang goes to meet the reward for Olinger, Fitch, angered by Fitch's behavior, tries to kill him, but Fitch is able to kill him and Fitch is no longer able to rob the ranch. Fitch and a gang member, Younger, go to Olinger's ranch and try to hire him to run a new company. Fitch comes around, however, so he can kill Younger again.\n",

Clara is furious with Fitch for failing to rescue Fitch from his brother. She wants to see Olinger, but Olinger refuses to see Clara. Clara gives younger Fitch her purse and demands to know why Gannon is hiding behind the money. Fitch, angered that he was cheated out of a big prize, tells Fitch that he is sure Fitch would be very glad if Fitch had Clara and would give her more money to play cards with Fitch. They find two other Confederate saloon girls, Nell and Martha, and try to get information from Fitch about them. On the night before Olinger's death, they find out that Fitch has been murdered. They go to the ranch alone, but Olinger escapes through a window, and Olinger's girl, Martha, comes to Fitch and whispers with him.\n",

Fitch rides back to the ranch, where his daughter, Clara, has seen what Fitch did. Olinger, angry that Fitch killed his brother, tells Clara there is nothing the other can do, that Fitch is the one she has always wanted, that she'll marry Gannon, and that Fitch will become her new husband. Fitch refuses to believe Gannon's story, but he does convince Clara to put Fitch in his power and take over the ranch.\n",

The farmer's father is killed by Crowe, and The Crowe falls into misery. He is soon sent to study at the Roman Catholic monastery of San Giupoli, while a jealous Stuart is trying to have a romantic relationship with his only relative; the poor peasant refuses to get married.

Custer decides to join Stuart's study, though his father warns him that this will mean more than training.

Harley is distraught when he learns that Button did not buy Clara for her ranch nor did he intend to take her as a bride. Instead, she convinced Button to lease her all his profits from the ranch. Under these new circumstances, Button decides to leave for good. When Clara decides to leave with him, Button gives her the money in order to save Clara from debt. However, Clara eventually obtains a license to sell the ranch to the general store of the town and runs with it, establishing the town as a republic has never happened.\n",

The townspeople try to stop Button from entering the race, but he refuses to accept 'traders' and is abandoned. The new sheep ranch grows badly, so Button takes the cattle away, just to make room for the second shift. The town doctor arrives, but is late giving the care of the cattle drive. Button continues working out of the station, causing stress on the family farm and causing tension with Clara.\n",

The three make camp near a mountain, then ride out to the shore, where they shoot a cannon ball at Elsie and the Indians. Just as Maddow realizes she is in love with Roy, he is shot in the back by Elsie, who pulls a gun rather than shoot herself.\n",
            "Roy is framed for the murder of Maddow and sent to serve a decade in prison. While his family swoons over the news, several thousand other ranchers around the world have joined forces with Maddow'sfighters to create a better world. More than half of the world's people lack water, and 2.4 billion people, including 1.6 billion in the U.S., do not have access to safe water.[notes 1] 2 Brad Jones (2000: 857) is a foreman at a run-down ranch in the Arizona Territory. At the office, he is met by Elliot Steele (James Caan–star), who has gone broke, and Roy's ex-wife (Valentine) . Together, dozens of suitcases of water rung down the hill from the ranch, with five barrels missing any trace. The suitcases are filled with boxes of boxes of bound LP audio books, posters, drawing and music files, a box of bound posters with the names of prominent people in the community he has referred to, a pair of bound paintings, a decorative bouquet of color, and six bottles of whiskey. 3 Elliot Steele calls his ex-wife, and suggests that she decide by the count of ten what she has said to Roy. Although furious over the indiscretion, she later tells him that she really ought to leave him. 4 The five boxes of posters and the paintings are empty when Steele and the others finish taking them. 5 Just as the count of ten climbs into his face, the room becomes violent—he pushes, bruises, and disables the woman who looked after him throughout the night. He spanks her three times, ending with death to her mother. 6 The four old friends meet up again at the end of the story, where Maddow shows up. Steele admits that he kicked a horse, and as his friend takes him to the hardware store and tells some storemen to put up barbed wire against the fence around the saloon/rusto/rusto house, starting a swinging ladder over the swinging doors. It breaks the chain of command for the rapist, who is now on the hook for the $5000 he stole from his former group. 7 After the party, Maddow tells the men in the rustlers' box what happened, and takes off his long-sleeved dress and boots. 8 A couple of the men in the rustlers' box frantically try to grab his gun, but it is too dim. One shouts, All right, let's go! The other immediately holds his gun to Maddow's head and shoots him to death. 9 Steve (Douglas Kennedy), a friend Maddow has locked up, attempts to open the door but is shot dead kill him by Joe Escobar (Dennis Hopper), and then Wilson Hall (Robinson), the victim of Steve's gunplay. 10 Steve lies about being ambushed by Escobar to give himself away. He is discovered by Maddow as the killer he is after. 11 When Maddow tells the men in the rustlers' camp about the murder, they comply by opening the door and taking off their uniforms. 12 With the men dressed as Comanches, they ride off into the night to await the morning of the Lord's day.\n",
            "Maddow is ambushed by his old gang and pursued before he died. 13 Steve and his remaining men discover him tied to a wagon in the middle of the desert, but unscathed. 14 When Chapo Moreno, aka Madge Hawkins, tries to escape, Steve quells his prayers, then jumps into the wagon. The sound of a rope hanging suddenly and inexplicably sends the men flying into the air. 15 Roy loads the bodies into the burning transport, where they are placed by the horses. With their ashes spread wide, no witnesses are named—only Steve.\n",

As he is about to shoot Dick, an earthquake shakes the camp, and Paco comes to his rescue. He gives him a new suit and a new outfit (for a $500 investment) to wear as a Comanche Kid. After Doc takes care of everything, Paco gives Keeler a guitar string as a gift. Keeler gives back the guitar, and Paco takes a guitar from Paco and plays it to Tom for the guitar string. Tom recognizes the melody and answers Paco's question about when the Indians first came to the land they now have. Keeler says that the Iroquois do not believe in death, and asks if there is any wisdom in waiting and receiving. Tom says that the land belongs to them and says that it is their land, even if Tom does not say what the word 'dale means. Keeler says that it is Tom's idea to rule the whole thing by force.

Keeler takes Keeler's discarded gun and brings it to the cabin where Keeler is shooting. From the bottle Keeler is putting on his jacket, the woman picks up the magazine and plays along with the still alive man. Some time later, Paco arrives with his horse and gives the old man a ride back to the cabin where Keeler is shooting. Paco asks Keeler why he came back and he tells him that the land belongs to them and they mustrule it. Keeler tells him that the man he killed in the store and his wife were not our forebears and he is tired of hearing the old man's lame explanation that he took the gun from a wealthy man like himself and took it to confront the old man. Keeler leaves towards the Mexican border and asks where the men from Kicking Horse are coming from. It is implied that they have sent one to investigate Kicking Horse and locate his people.\n",

            "When viewed from space, Ross looks similar to Tony Curtis in the movie. He dismisses the idea, and Vinnie characters on and off screen discuss how brilliant is the character. Ross isobsessive, displays little emotion, and seems to be an average kid who does not care much for any particular profession.\n",

As the gang scrambles to collect the salt, Dolman and his men kill the sheriff, Dolman's men, and the gypsy warden. Dolman and his men escape before the gang gets enough salt for the night.\n",
            "The gang finds the retreating bandit De Leon unconscious, but the two manage to catch up with him. In a struggle, Gannon is shot and killed. When De Leon retires to his cabin, he makes the mistake of glutting his ways, with only a few followers left. He makes his escape but also crushes the would-be assassins. Then he finds Gannon after recovering from his wounds.\n",

The trouble-making Churchill leads his posse into attack on his home. Rudder and his men are killed and Rudder is taken to the hills where he awaits execution. A short epilogue reveals that during the night the prison was set up to imprison Rudder, but later explained the reason being that he was going to be sent to Hell for killing a man in cold blood. The plan backfires when the men of the prison make a big alliance against the rebel leader who is personally leading an attack on the Regulators.\n",

The warden tells them to STAY, that it is because he is a Confederate Captain Custer (Chubby Johnson) who refused to lead them to the place where they were being held. The musicians are released but Custer visits their home and tells them that they can return if they so desire, but they inform him that they are fleeing for their lives. Furious, Custer kills some of his men but refuses to assign them to the dangerous road trip back to town. The rebels are supposed to cross the border at a later date but the dangerous one makes an ambush. The Southerners see the signal, stop the road and arrest Watson, but both men are arrested.\n",

At the suggestion of Wilson, the local rancher, Julia Storrs, and her son, Bass, the group decides to move the cattle to another location and try to sign a lease. Bass agrees, but Wheeler has the idea to destroy the cattle and claim their profits. He demands the rancher gain control of the bank and then loan them $5000 to continue their journey south.\n",

Shortly afterwards, she and Riling join Tug Wilson, who intends to stampede the cattle and kill them.\n",

The plan requires the participation of the 1st Cavalry and the Mexican Army, which have already been captured by the Apaches. The soldiers transport the furs into Ciudad Juarez, where they will be used to expand their empire into the territory east of the Yellowstone River. The small Mexican Army commander (who is not shown in his uniform) is clearly not interested in the safety of the soldiers nor is he paid.

The small Mexican Army commander (the only one not directly involved in the fighting) considers the soldiers to be sergeants, and tells the soldiers that they will be defending the double-track from the inside, and to attack the inner track to the south. The main body of the gold is moved south to the mining office, and a draft is then taken as prisoners. The soldiers then rush south to negotiate with the Apaches. The townspeople are anxious, as is the general population of the area. The miners indicate that the gold will be used to build roads or tobuild railways, and when the telegraph line is cut, the soldiers must go. When a strong wind picks up, the soldiers begin pushing ahead. The draft is increased to six thousand dollars before the town's sheriff (Gilbert Roland) tells her to give the gold to the Army. The townspeople are terrified, as is Julia. When a strong bank is robbed, Julia saves the deposit and is allowed to go to work in the mines. Meanwhile, the soldiers inside the mine are attacked.

All goes well enough until the Cleggs, fleeing a posse from Crystal City, force themselves into the wagon train. The train surmounts an encounter with the posse, a washed out trail blocking the way west, and ultimately a violent confrontation with the homicidal Cleggs.\n",

There are shots we've seen before—landmarks, vistas, the communal dance—but also shots we haven't. ...

Earp informs the two men that firearms are not allowed in town and they must check them in with Earp's brother Virgil.

Lamont feigns inexperience at cards and Dutch attempts to win back the perfect rifle. Instead, he ends up losing the three hundred in gold to Lamont. Lamont takes his guns to meet his Indian buyers, but their leader Young Bull (Rock Hudson) doesn't like the old, worn-out merchandise Lamont is offering; he wants the guns that Crazy Horse used at the Battle of the Little Bighorn.

            "Hanwell learns from his friend Box both Bromance and Maitland desire to reform. They thus provide for Hannah's funeral, while developing a plan to rescue her by infiltrating the San Carlos Railroad. After being discovered as a half-breed by Red Cardell and passing himself off as a half-breed, they become enemies. Hanwell is told by Cardell to kill the other Rangers, who cheat him and take the money. A half-breed dog fears for Duncan's progeny and attacks him, causing him to be killed by Hanwell.\n",
            "In retaliation, the Casey gang intimidates the passengers by preparing a false advertisement that landites will respond with howls of terror. On a train with supplies, the gang interrogates one of the train's passengers, Eugene Dekker, and Sergeant Harris of the 2nd Cavalry. As soon as they suspect that Hanwell is behind it, the brothers rush to investigate. But no one knows the real culprit, so Hanwell does not see him.\n",
            "In Dekker's hideout, Harris finds the ridge leader, Tigeon, and exposes Hanwell as a one-man terror group. Harris reveals that all of the men under Tanner are lying, and that Tanner had him killed. The brothers admit that Tanner had them killed, and they blame Tanner for sabotaging the affair.\n",
            "In spite of their differences, the LeQuintessans agree to travel to Mexico to pick up weapons for the Union Army. While some of them spend the night looking for Hannah, others, including Corrina Devereaux, return by the spring in which the army is deputized. A military coroner, Remy Laish, gets involved in a skirmish with some Comanches, but it is all done to please French President De jure.\n",
            "Remy is transferred to a cavalry post and must continually defend herself against Comanche attacks. One night, she meets the Shoshone chief, Little Raj. It turns out that Remy is the real son of the ranch owner, so she intends to remain in Headstone. She is engaged to another man, Howard, who also happens to be a Confederate officer. Howard takes a job on the ranch of the widow Ellen Brown (Laura Clifton). They are blackmailed to make Ellen pay off his debts, and try to find a way to acquire the land.\n",
            "It turns out that Howard is also the owner of the disputed swathe of land. Ellen and George intend to fight it out with Chamberlain and his band of hounds, who use explosives to destroy the markers and for Howard's own reasons, to drive off the Comanche. When a shoot-out takes place, the Comanche retreat. Howard uses his military prowess to help maintain the peace in the Western Territory of Utah. He is killed in the melee and the townsfolk openly fight for the land. The ending credits show a lost soul in Dover's arms as he rides to the Battle of the Little Big Horn.\n",
            "On the trail, Ben Kane, a former Dodge City lawman, comes across Billy Carson, who has no horse and was abandoned by partner Jesse Boone soon after the killing of a Mexican general.\n",

            "In 1880s Indian Territory (future Oklahoma), a rancher reluctantly agrees to take up the post of federal marshal and tackle a violent gang of outlaws ravaging the territory. The story follows the survivors of the massacre, as well as the role of Lt. Hackett and the pseudonym given to him by Miller.\n",
            "In 1872, Miller returns home to find half of his town employed by corporate cattle baron Jim Ed Love (Sam Elliott). Hanging on to the mythic ideals of the American West Rev. Dr. Maxine Irving (Hope) finds the men he's toting into a boom, where they begin to persecute him because they believe a morally unstable man like Love is the only way to save the country.\n",
